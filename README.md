- 👋 Hi, I’m @SarahLentz
- 👀 I’m interested in developing my coding skills for both fullstack web development and mobile app development, as well as API software documentation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning frontend web development (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, ReactJS, etc.) and API documentation. 
- 💞️ I’m looking for full-time work as a tech writer or web developer (or a hybrid of both). 
- 📫 You can reach me via email at sarahlentz@gmail.com or on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/lentzsarah/.
